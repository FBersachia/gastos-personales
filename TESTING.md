## üîÑ Integration Testing

### User Flow: Setting Up Payment Methods
1. [ ] User logs in
2. [ ] Navigates to Payment Methods page
3. [ ] Sees empty state
4. [ ] Creates first payment method
5. [ ] Creates second payment method
6. [ ] Edits a payment method
7. [ ] Tries to create duplicate (should fail)
8. [ ] Deletes a payment method
9. [ ] Logs out and back in
10. [ ] Sees saved payment methods

### User Flow: Setting Up Categories
1. [ ] User navigates to Categories page
2. [ ] Creates macro category "Food"
3. [ ] Creates macro category "Transport"
4. [ ] Creates category "Groceries" linked to "Food"
5. [ ] Creates category "Restaurants" linked to "Food"
6. [ ] Creates category "Uber" linked to "Transport"
7. [ ] Filters by "Food" macro - sees 2 categories

## üìù Notes

- Mark items as you test them
- Document any bugs found in `errors.md`
- Take screenshots of UI issues
- Record steps to reproduce bugs
- Test with different user accounts
- Clear localStorage between test sessions for auth testing

---

**Testing Status:** Not Started

**Next Steps:**
1. Choose testing approach (manual vs automated)
2. Set up testing tools if doing automated tests
3. Work through checklist systematically
4. Document any issues found
5. Fix critical bugs before Sprint 2
